# Vb.net_New_FileTreeViewer
Microsoft is ready to toss "DriveListBox" "DirListBox" "FileListBox" into the trash heap of history.

To avoid having to handwrite a new TreeView based file manager every time, I've written this sample project, just copy and paste my own sub in it every time you use it.

The source code has comments written in very bad English, so that should help.

微软准备把"DriveListBox""DirListBox""FileListBox"丢进历史的垃圾堆了。

为了防止每次都要重新手写基于TreeView的新的文件管理器，我写了这么个示例工程，每次使用只要复制粘贴里面我自己写的Sub就可以了。

源代码有用很烂的英语写的注释，应该能有所帮助。
